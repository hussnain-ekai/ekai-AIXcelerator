Business Requirements Document: Renewable Project Pipeline Tracker

1. Executive Summary

1.1 Business Problem

Business development teams currently lack a consolidated, forward-looking view of the renewable energy market. Identifying emerging markets and forecasting future capacity additions is difficult without a centralized list of projects that are in the development pipeline but not yet operational. This lack of visibility risks missing market entry opportunities before competitors establish a presence.

1.2 Proposed Solution

Development of a "Renewable Project Pipeline Tracker." This solution will provide a list of all proposed solar, wind, and storage projects across the country that are awaiting construction. It will enable the business to identify emerging geographic markets and forecast future capacity additions by technology type.

2. Business Context

2.1 Business Drivers

Market Identification: Ability to spot states and counties with high volumes of proposed activity.
Capacity Forecasting: Accurate estimation of future megawatts (MW) coming online.
Competitive Intelligence: Visibility into the pre-operational landscape.
2.2 Core Business Concepts (Glossary)

The following terms define the semantic layer of the pipeline tracker:

Renewable Project Pipeline: A collection of all proposed renewable energy projects awaiting construction to identify emerging markets and forecast future capacity.
Proposed Project: A renewable energy project that has been planned but is awaiting construction and has not yet become operational (Status must equal 'proposed').
Operational Status: The current state of a generator project indicating whether it is proposed, operational, retired, or in another status.
Generator Identifier (Project ID): A unique identifier assigned to each proposed renewable energy project in the pipeline.
Plant Identifier (EIA ID): The EIA assigned identifier for a power plant facility; used to link generators to location data.
Plant Name: The human-readable name or facility name of a power plant.
Plant Location: The geographic location of a renewable energy facility identified by state and county.
Prime Mover: The technology type or equipment that generates electricity (PV, WT, BA, FW, CE, CP).
Energy Source: The primary fuel or natural resource used (e.g., SUN, WND, MWH).
Planned Capacity: The expected megawatt (MW) output of a proposed renewable energy project when it becomes operational.
Planned Online Date: The expected date when a proposed renewable energy project will become operational.
Wind Turbine (WT): Wind energy technology that converts wind kinetic energy into electricity.
Photovoltaic (PV): Solar technology that converts sunlight directly into electricity using semiconductor materials.
DC Capacity: The direct current (DC) capacity measured in megawatts for solar photovoltaic projects.
Concentrated Solar Power (CP): Solar technology that uses mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight to generate heat and electricity.
Battery Storage (BA): Energy storage technology using battery systems to store electrical energy.
Flywheel (FW): Energy storage technology that stores energy in a rotating mass.
Compressed Air Energy Storage (CE): Storage technology that compresses air for later expansion.
Snapshot: A point-in-time view of data representing the state of information at a specific date.
Refresh: The frequency at which the dataset is updated (Monthly).
2.3 Key Metrics & Formulae

State Pipeline Total: Total planned capacity in megawatts for all proposed renewable projects grouped by state.
Formula: SUM(capacity_mw) GROUP BY state
Technology Pipeline Total: Total planned capacity in megawatts for all proposed renewable projects grouped by technology type.
Formula: SUM(capacity_mw) GROUP BY prime_mover_code
Project Count by State: Count of distinct proposed renewable energy projects grouped by state.
Formula: COUNT(DISTINCT generator_id) GROUP BY state
Planned Capacity: Measurement of expected output.
Solar DC Capacity: Measurement of DC capacity (Specific to Solar PV).
3. Data Quality Rules

The following rules must be applied to ensure the integrity of the Pipeline Tracker.

3.1 Grain Determination & Status Scope

Grain: Entity. The dataset must represent one row per unique Project (generator_id) per reporting period (report_date).
Proposed Status Filter (Critical): Only projects with operational_status equal to 'proposed' are included. This is the defining constraint of the "Pipeline."
Technology Code Enumeration: prime_mover_code must be one of the following valid renewable types: 'PV', 'WT', 'BA', 'FW', 'CE', 'CP'.
Energy Source Enumeration: energy_source_code_1 must be one of: 'SUN', 'WND', 'MWH'.
3.2 Measure Classification

Additive Measures: capacity_mw and net_capacity_mwdc (DC Capacity) are additive. They can be summed across States and Technology types to derive pipeline totals.
Non-Additive Measures: generator_id counts are distinct.
3.3 Referential Checks & Joins

Plant Location Join: Every proposed generator must link to a valid Plant entity via plant_id_eia to retrieve State, County, and Plant Name.
Solar DC Capacity Logic: The field net_capacity_mwdc is only relevant/populated where prime_mover_code = 'PV'.
3.4 Temporal Constraints

Snapshot Logic: Data should reflect the latest available report_date snapshot to ensure the pipeline is current.
Monthly Refresh: The dataset is expected to be refreshed monthly.
4. Data Requirements

4.1 Data Modeling Approach

The data model requires joining the central Generator attributes (Status, Capacity, Online Date) with specific technology tables (Solar, Wind, Storage) and Plant location data.

Primary Key: generator_id (within a specific report_date snapshot).
Filtering: Apply the "Proposed" status filter early in the pipeline.
4.2 Identified Entities & Metadata

The following specific technology entities have been identified as relevant for the pipeline details:
